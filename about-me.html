      <p>I am Willie Tay and I am currently working in Singapore Polytechnic FabLab as a lecturer. I am a trained Industrial Designer and an Additive Manufacturing Specialist. I have acquired a series of multi-disciplinary expertise in various fields of design and fabrication. I have worked with various partners and companies in providing design solutions as well as design fabrication, ranging from furniture, automotive &amp; aerospace, exhibition, space &amp; interior, consumer products, jewelry, UX, medical devices to visual merchandising. </p>
     
<h2>Previous Work</h2>

      <p>I used to worked in the Design Incubation Centre, Singapore first design research lab located in the National University of Singapore as a lead designer &amp; reseacher working on  â€‹design methodology,&nbsp; design projects as well as teaching design module to students from the Division of Industrial Design.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <h3>Notable Project - Generative Swab (AKA. Python Swab)</h3>

      <p>One of my best work done was the creation of Singapore first 3D printed Swab Design which was eventually licensed to Temesak Foundation, a non-profit organization under the philanthropic arm of the Singapore state sovereign fund Temasek Holdings. My generative swab design idea was adopted by the project team leaded Professor John Eu-Li Wong, NUS Senior Vice President (Health Innovation &amp; Translation) as well as the various stakeholders and design teams within National University of Singapore.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
